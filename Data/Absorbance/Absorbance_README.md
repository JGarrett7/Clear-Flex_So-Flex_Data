So-Flex_II Folder:

Contains absorbance data taken on a UV-1800 spectrophotometer for a glass cuvette (VWR 10037-462) filled with only So-Flex II. The spectrophotometer was baselined on an empty cuvette, which leads to the negative absorbance as noted in the paper.

Empty_Glass:

Contains absorbance data taken on a UV-1800 spectrophotometer for an empty glass cuvette (VWR 10037-462). The spectrophotometer was baselined on nothing (air).

Other folders:

Contain absorbance data taken on a UV-1800 spectrophotometer for a glass cuvette (VWR 10037-462) filled with some ratio of Clear Flex 30 and So-Flex II. The spectrophotometer was baselined on an empty cuvette, which leads to the negative absorbance as noted in the paper. File and folder naming convention is as follows: YYYY-MM-DD_mm-dd_10-R. In which YYYY is year, MM is month, DD is day, mm is the batch creation month, dd is the batch creation day, and R is the ratio of So-Flex II in the sample tested.
